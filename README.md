# Flowdock.NET

A Flowdock client for Windows Phone 8, and maybe even Windows 8 Metro

**Note:** This is a Rally employee hackathon project, no promises anything will ever come of this just yet!

# To Build

## Get Visual Studio

You need [Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone](https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads), this is a 1.6GB download, and Microsoft's servers can be very slow at times. So if you want, grab it from the Rally corp network at `groups/Engineering/Installers/Visual Studio 2012/`

### Go Pro?

There are advantages to using the non-express versions of Visual Studio, so we may switch to that.

## Update nuget packages

<TODO>: fill this in once I get back to a Windows box :)
